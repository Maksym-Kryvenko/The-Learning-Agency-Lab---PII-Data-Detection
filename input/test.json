[{"document":7,"full_text":"Design Thinking for innovation reflexion-Avril 2021-Nathalie Sylla\n\nChallenge & selection\n\nThe tool I use to help all stakeholders finding their way through the complexity of a project is the  mind map.\n\nWhat exactly is a mind map? According to the definition of Buzan T. and Buzan B. (1999, Dessine-moi  l'intelligence. Paris: Les \u00c9ditions d'Organisation.), the mind map (or heuristic diagram) is a graphic  representation technique that follows the natural functioning of the mind and allows the brain's  potential to be released. Cf Annex1\n\nThis tool has many advantages:\n\n\u2022  It is accessible to all and does not require significant material investment and can be done  quickly\n\n\u2022  It is scalable\n\n\u2022  It allows categorization and linking of information\n\n\u2022  It can be applied to any type of situation: notetaking, problem solving, analysis, creation of  new ideas\n\n\u2022  It is suitable for all people and is easy to learn\n\n\u2022  It is fun and encourages exchanges\n\n\u2022  It makes visible the dimension of projects, opportunities, interconnections\n\n\u2022  It synthesizes\n\n\u2022  It makes the project understandable\n\n\u2022  It allows you to explore ideas\n\nThe creation of a mind map starts with an idea\/problem located at its center. This starting point  generates ideas\/work areas, incremented around this center in a radial structure, which in turn is  completed with as many branches as new ideas.\n\nThis tool enables creativity and logic to be mobilized, it is a map of the thoughts.\n\nCreativity is enhanced because participants feel comfortable with the method.\n\nApplication & Insight\n\nI start the process of the mind map creation with the stakeholders standing around a large board  (white or paper board). In the center of the board, I write and highlight the topic to design.\n\nThrough a series of questions, I guide the stakeholders in modelling the mind map. I adapt the series  of questions according to the topic to be addressed. In the type of questions, we can use: who, what,  when, where, why, how, how much.\n\nThe use of the \u201cwhy\u201d is very interesting to understand the origin. By this way, the interviewed person  frees itself from paradigms and thus dares to propose new ideas \/ ways of functioning. I plan two  hours for a workshop.\n\nDesign Thinking for innovation reflexion-Avril 2021-Nathalie Sylla\n\nAfter modelling the mind map on paper, I propose to the participants a digital visualization of their  work with the addition of color codes, images and interconnections. This second workshop also lasts  two hours and allows the mind map to evolve. Once familiarized with it, the stakeholders discover  the power of the tool. Then, the second workshop brings out even more ideas and constructive  exchanges between the stakeholders. Around this new mind map, they have learned to work  together and want to make visible the untold ideas.\n\nI now present all the projects I manage in this type of format in order to ease rapid understanding for  decision-makers. These presentations are the core of my business models. The decision-makers are  thus able to identify the opportunities of the projects and can take quick decisions to validate them.  They find answers to their questions thank to a schematic representation.\n\nApproach\n\nWhat I find amazing with the facilitation of this type of workshop is the participants commitment for  the project. This tool helps to give meaning. The participants appropriate the story and want to keep  writing it. Then, they easily become actors or sponsors of the project. A trust relationship is built,  thus facilitating the implementation of related actions.\n\nDesign Thinking for innovation reflexion-Avril 2021-Nathalie Sylla\n\nAnnex 1: Mind Map Shared facilities

Estrada\n\nDesign Thinking Assignment\n\nVisualization Tool\n\nChallenge & Selection\n\nThe elderly were having a hard time adapting to the changes we brought in our bank. As  a result of a poorly implemented linear solution, a more customer centric approach was  needed.\n\nAfter learning about design thinking in this course, we decided to apply it to solve this  problem. The visualization tool allowed the team to create a dynamic presentation using  diagrams, figures and drawings on the go that really resonated among the stakeholders.  Previous to this change, none of our solutions seemed to be adequate for them, but the  new implementation created a different type of connection with them that helped them  understand the problem in the way the team and I did.\n\nApplication\n\nThe process starts in the prep time. The team uses a series of tools and software to  develop a presentation using the surveys gathered during research and the solutions we  created during the process. The use of graphs to quickly show statistics in a fully visual  way, rather than verbally was a game changer.\n\nAfter having a presentation prepared, the team hands an activity to the stakeholders,  where the solutions discussed previously appear. Nonetheless, the solutions need more  work to them. After this. The stakeholders are asked to help complete the solutions  while the team and I create diagrams on a blackboard to represent how their  suggestions would impact on this specific problem.\n\nThe use of a group activity strengthens the bond between the company and their  investors. It makes them feel like they take part and help solve the problems as well as  show how customer centric the solutions are. Every complaint and suggestion from  customers are read and evaluated using the graph shown in the course (Involving: can  we do it? Can we afford it? \u2026). The finalization of this activity leaves the team and the  stakeholders on the same page. It allows them to completely understand and feel part  of the solution and also gives them the chance to ask better questions, which eases the  work of the team.\n\nInsight & Approach\n\nThe use of this method created a new workflow in the Design Team. It increased the  productivity and the success rate as well as the customer\/stakeholders satisfaction. The  use of the visualization tool created an engaged group of people who work together to\n\nDiego Estrada\n\nfind a solution based on their customer satisfaction. This solution is later revised and  tweaked with the help of the stakeholders who are deeply involved in the process.\n\nPresentations, graphics, and activities have added a huge increase in satisfaction. As a  company we also learnt that engaging different areas can be difficult because of the  varying levels of understanding, but when paired with the adequate process things just  flow.\n\n(This story

process\n\nby Gilberto Gamboa\n\nChallenge\n\nI received a promotion of being the Regional Controller, along with my actual position of\n\nCountry CFO. The main responsibility of this new position was to weekly report the results\n\nfor the week and estimate the final results of the month of 4 countries and consolidated\n\nthose.\n\nWhen I was receiving the position, I went to visit my colleague, former Regional Controller,\n\nwho was promoted to Country CEO and now had interest conflicts of being the controller.\n\nThe process to consolidate the information of the 4 countries was that the country controllers\n\nsent him an email with the main figures for the week, he forwarded those to his country\n\naccountant who consolidated it, the accountant sent him the consolidated report and he\n\nfinally reported to the headquarters. The whole process took almost a full business day to\n\ncomplete.\n\nGiven that my responsibilities as Country CFO demanded more attention because my\n\ncountry had more operations, I decided to change the process in order to reduce the\n\nduration and to ensure standardization in the format, and actually, reduce the human\n\nintervention, making that the country controllers work directly in the consolidation file.\n\nSelection\n\nHaving in mind that there was a different kind of users of file, I select some of those to\n\ndetermine what was the main important things to take into account in the moment of the\n\nprocess of the information and the reading of the same. In that sense, we form a group of\n\nthe country controllers, country CEOs, IT guys, and people from the headquarters to find the\n\nbest solutions possible.\n\nApplication\n\nFor the first lunch, we focused on the consolidation process in order to avoid the copy-paste\n\nprocesses and reducing the manual intervention so, we build an online application where all\n\nthe controllers fill the figure of their respective country, along with the comments. During the\n\nfirst week of the first stage, we sent the new report along with the old one, and after the\n\nmeeting with the headquarters team, we ask for a post-meeting review of the new format, all\n\nthe assistants provided their comments and suggestions that were the input for the next\n\nreport.\n\nFor the second lunch, we focused on the feedback received from the assistants to the review\n\nmeeting, we adjust the report and we were able to eliminate the old one. The final report\n\nincluded all the suggestions received but the best of all is that reduced the time investment\n\nfrom about 36 men hours to around 8, without missing any valuable information and\n\nincluding new data that the stakeholders appreciated so much.\n\nInsight\n\nWith the application of the learning launch tool, the controller\u2019s team along with the main\n\nstakeholders identified different assumptions and designed tools to test these assumptions.\n\nOn the other hand, we found probable requirements from headquarters, expecting to find\n\nthat a more agile approach that improved the workflow, reduced the time investment of\n\neveryone in the team and that both our team and the key stakeholders were very satisfied\n\nwith the results of the exercise and the new report.\n\nThe final report was slightly different from what we anticipated, but the differences were\n\nmore related to form and a few topics to be included in the report.\n\nApproach\n\nDespite that, the team was not used to design thinking tools, they were able to work with the\n\nlearning launch that was the appropriate tool.

Thinking for Innovation\n\nSindy Samaca\n\nGitam University\n\nDecember,  2021\n\nChallenge\n\nMy challenge to solve is the problem of a company that is without\n\nsufficient capital to create and build its own industrial plant, and cannot\n\ncope with the growing demand that they have had in the last two months.\n\nThe company is in a dilemma, as it has two potential investors; The first\n\ninvestor offers the amount of capital necessary for the creation of the\n\nplant, in return he asks to intervene in the process and make certain\n\nchanges in the final product since he thinks that the idea he has has\n\nshown good results in previous years and to have the participation of 50%\n\nin the company, the second investor offers the capital necessary for the\n\ncreation of the plant in exchange for do not make modifications to the\n\nfinal product, since this is the one that is generating the exponential\n\ngrowth of the company, for the moment it is only asked to focus on the\n\ncompany's success product and as they recover the investment they can\n\nbe extended to the innovation of products and creation for a 20% stake\n\nwithin the company.\n\nAs a manager of the company, I need to make the best decision for the\n\nabove mentioned one.\n\nSelection\n\nI decided to choose the visualization tool, visualization allows me to\n\nunderstand and analyze the context, to be able to define the needs and\n\ntheir possible solutions. This tool is useful for me to have a clearer vision\n\nof the current state of the company and what it ultimately requires;\n\nthrough this tool I can deduce the personalities of the two investors, such\n\nas George and Geoff; and based on this I can make the best decision.\n\nApplication\n\nIn the application of my chosen tool to the challenge that I have set\n\nmyself, the tool has been of a very wide utility, since when applying it to\n\nmy challenge very good results were obtained, since with this I could have\n\nan analysis to the measure of the two investors. The first thing I did with\n\nmy visualization tool was to conduct a study to customers who required\n\nthe flagship product of the company, first I had to understand why the\n\ndemand had had such a strong growth in the last two months, by applying\n\nthe tool I could find the answers to this question; I could see that\n\ncustomers needed this product as it was, without any modification\n\nbecause the product worked wonders.\n\nWith this study of the clients interested in the product, I was able to\n\nanalyze and follow up on the proposals I had on the table from the two\n\ninvestors.\n\nI concluded that I needed the person who was interested in the first\n\ninstance to supply the product that was having great success. Which was\n\nthe second investor, since he was interested in first of all to give the size\n\nof production that our customers demanded, and then worry about\n\nimproving it, but in small and concise steps.\n\nI discarded the first investor, as he did not meet the requirements that the\n\ncompany needed at that time. I realized that this investor was convinced\n\nthat by changing the product to the way he thought, the demand was\n\ngoing to increase more; but in reality what the company needed was to be\n\nable to cover the demand that the product was having, this investor\n\nwanted to throw everything we had, to the side of the road, but he did not\n\nthink for a moment that these modifications should have a low impact in\n\ncase things do not go as well as expected.\n\nThanks to the application of the tool I was able to identify the key points\n\nof the company's needs and how each investor, according to their\n\nproposals, could help me, based on this I made the best decision. I chose\n\nto work with the second investor, we were able to supply the demand for\n\nthe product, then the investment tripled and we were able to inject it into\n\nresearch for product innovation, and make some small changes, which\n\nwere being introduced to customers discreetly and in small quantities.\n\nWhen customers became more interested in the improved product, we\n\ndecided to increase production by improving the product.\n\nPerspective\n\nThe information and the final lesson that I had when socializing what we\n\nobtained by using the visualization tool, the first thing is that we must\n\nalways think first about the needs of customers, of the people interested\n\nin the product; it is very useful to know what the problem is, what is the\n\ncause of the problem and finally build an effective solution. Secondly,\n\nbased on what we have obtained, we can find a partner that fits our\n\nneeds, and be able to work as a team, unifying ideas and producing\n\npossible solutions. Thanks to the knowledge gained from the design\n\ncourse, I was able to create a strategic plan for the company's problems\n\nand make it a successful plan.\n\nApproach\n\nWhat I would apply differently in the challenge would be the tool used, I\n\nwould like to use the learning launch; I would do it in the following way,\n\nrejecting the proposals of the two investors and only creating the way that\n\nthe production process would be decreased to be able to supply the\n\nrequired demand. It may or may not work out, but I would like to have\n\nemployed this strategy.\n\n","tokens":["Design","Thinking","for","Innovation","\n\n","Sindy","Samaca","\n\n","Gitam","University","\n\n","December",",","

Startup - Learning Launch \u200bby Eladio Amaya\n\nChallenge\n\nWe are a small company in Barcelona (Spain) that refines high-quality organic cheeses  from small producers in the Pyrenees. We also trade milk and yogurts from these  producers. We distribute our dairy products mainly to haute cuisine restaurants (60% of  our turnover) and to Delicatesens stores (35% of our turnover), the remaining 5% we  distribute to individuals, mainly family, friends and acquaintances.    Selection\n\nI have chosen the \"Learning Launch\" because it is more adapted to my way of working  and the needs of the company.    Application\n\nDue to the coronavirus crisis, all restaurants have closed and Delicatesen store sales  have dropped dramatically. therefore we have had to change our target niche and head  towards private individuals and common stores.    We have carried out a survey both in small stores and among individuals. In the survey  we asked what types of cheese are the most willing to consume, as well as milk and  yogurts, also the type of milk (goat, cow, sheep), the level of curing and the price they  would be willing to pay for our products. We have also proposed sending boxes with  different products on offer, in which the average price is significantly lower.    After the survey and the observations of individuals and small stores, we have focused  our offer on a certain type of product, we have distributed it and analyzed the result not  only with our customers but also with objective sales figures.    Insight\n\nThe result has been spectacular, our weekly turnover had fallen to 25% with a loss of  75% (60% of restaurants and 15% of delicatessen stores). The situation was dramatic  but nowadays sales to individuals have risen from 5% to 25% and common food stores  have gone from 0% to 15%.\n\nApproach\n\nOur situation is not good, but we hope that when the restaurants open and the economy  recovers. We will have a much broader portfolio of clients and a way of working based  on the client and transferred to the producer. Before, we used to transfer products from  small producers to customers. Now the flow has changed.\n\n","tokens":["Cheese","Startup","-","Learning","Launch","\u200bby","Eladio","Amaya","\n\n","Challenge","\n\n","We","are","a","small","company","in","Barcelona","(","Spain",")","that","refines","high","-","quality","organic","cheeses","

In such scenarios, storytelling  can turn the table significantly. I have used the tool \u2018storytelling\u2019 in my organization to convey a  complicated message as simply as possible or to generate ideas from people around me. The idea  is to implement this innovative tool to make the intricate issues understandable and engage the  targeted audience. I relayed the context of the story to captivate the attention of the audience. I  have used the technique in front of my team-members of the organization to impart its essence,  brainstorm notions, make productive connections and develop appropriate strategies. The crucial  element in storytelling is to engagingly answer the questions raised in the story to its targeted  audience and allow them to resonate with the core subject of the story. When I shared the story, I  tried to gain the insights from the audience as to how the characters inspire them and how it  related to their work emotions. The information and feedback immensely helped me in  recognizing its importance in finding solutions in real world.\n\nApplication\n\nI used the storytelling tool in an organizational meeting to help the team members visualize the  essence and impact of revolutionary thinking. I understood that the story has to make sense so  that they can comprehend the context and relate with it. I started the story of the time when there  was an emergence of deadly diseases due to mosquitoes i.e. malaria etc. and a company brought  a revolution by introducing a range of mosquito repellent products. I emphasized on its out-of- the box thinking & ideas that made the brand conquer the market. I observed that my audience  were sincerely engaged and were emotionally connected with the company. After I finished, there  were questions and productive interactions which exhibited that they relate it with their ongoing  project. The enthusiasm of thinking afresh was quite overwhelming.\n\nInsight & Approach\n\nWhen I analysed the whole series of events it made me wonder, \u201cDid my tool work? The answer I  think is \u2018YES\u2019. Will it serve the purpose? I think that time will tell but I believe it will certainly aid  them in making apt strategies.\u201d\n\nThe exercise portrayed that a revolutionary story can influence a small number of people then  storytelling as a design-thinking tool, if implemented efficiently, can bring ground-breaking  changes in organizations & countries. I observed that my story engaged my targeted audience,  inspired them to think new and deliver better results.\n\nAs a student of design thinking, I can explore this tool from all corners and can confidently say  that I can creatively use it in number of inspiring ways at any appropriate phase of design thinking  activities.\n\n","tokens":["Storytelling","

\u2013 Learning Launch\n\nFrancisco Ferreira\n\nChallenge\n\nI take part of a social enterprenuership group in my university. We were in contact\n\nwith Cap\u00e3o das Antas, a rural Community in the suburbs of S\u00e3o Carlos (SP-Brazil). We had the  intention to criate, with the local producers, a project that wold improve the quality of life in  the neighborhood. For that, in the first two months we begin to listen each farmer of Cap\u00e3o  and try identify the principal issues of the place and their residentes. After some visits we  concluded that the principal problem was selling the products that they plant in the local  farms. Therefore, we had the objective to make and test a business model that would increase  their rent.\n\nSelection\n\nIn order to build a sustainable business model with the farmers, we made a first test\n\nwere we delivered the products at the costumer\u2019s door. The action had a good result but we  want to increase even more ours sales. So we used Learning Launchs to test new ideais and  then improve our business model.\n\nApplication\n\nAfter we analise all the data we had and build the business model, Its was far from be\n\nthe most sustainable and profitable one. To improve our project, we made a plan to test new  ways of seling. So every week, after we analise all the process from the farm to the costumer  door, we propose and teste the improvement in the current business model.\n\nIn order to give examples of how it works, after some weeks we notice that the\n\nfarmers were having problems in separate the orders. The costumers were ordering with na  app called whatsapp, but the person who was responsable for taking note of the orders was  messy with the conversations feed. As soon as we notice this problem we proposed a new app  that automatically cluster the orders in a simple feed. Therefore we tested this improvement  in the next week and got zero mistakes in separating the orders.\n\nInsights\n\nThe application of Learning Launches showed me how testing is importante in building\n\na solid business model. Therefore, I learned that the more you test possibles ideias, more  chance of sucess you have. Testing a lot of improvement and ideas is not the fastest way to  achieve a better scenario but is cleary a certainly strategy to get there.\n\nApproach\n\nDuring all the improvement plan that we act every week we propose changes based on\n\nwhat we were seeing during the deliveries. I think that we could have achieved better results  by analysis more sources of data, like feedback from all the stakeholders. Besides that we  could have made a better knowledge management of the changes proposed for the business  model.\n\n","tokens":["Reflection","\u2013","Learning","Launch","\n\n","Francisco","Ferreira","\n\n","Challenge","\n\n","I","take","part","of","a","social","enterprenuership","group","in","my","university",".","We","were","in","contact","\n\n","with","Cap\u00e3o","das","Antas",",","a","rural","Community","in","the","suburbs","of","S\u00e3o","Carlos","(","SP","-","Brazil",")",".","We","had","the","

student\n\nSathyabama\n\nApril, 2020\n\nIn many classical economic theories, it is common to determine a human, as a very egoistic  creature. Adam Smith\u2019s books (but not all of them) were wrote based on this idea also.  However, the conception of Homo economicus was introduced for the first time by John Stuart  Mill in the nineteens century and it assumes, that all human beings are consistently rational,  narrowly self-interested, and who pursue their subjectively-defined ends optimally1. However,  in our real life we face acts of altruism very often: our parents provide us with all necessary  goods, a lot of businessmen give money for charity and even strangers give money to homeless  people. So, it is very clear, that people do not necessarily acts in their own interests all the time,  they also tend to help others. But what makes them to do this? Why are people sometimes  altruistic?\n\nGerashchenko Igor in his article \u201cThe ethical teaching of A. Smith in the context of the modern  economy\u201d writes, that altruism has been existing from the very times of primitive man, as a  single egoistic individual was not capable to survive out of his or her community. All resources  were so difficult to get, that the efforts of the whole pride were essential in struggle for  survival. The following way the system of social values, where helping other people is highly  appreciated, started to form. The ideology of individualism instead of collectivism has appeared  much time later, when the market economy gave us a possibility to live independently from  each other, or to form smaller communities, as nuclear families. But even now, in modern word  and in modern families, we can see people continue to act in altruistic way. So, let\u2019s try to  discover, what other motives, besides ancient habit, do they have.\n\nOne of the mechanisms, which makes people act in altruistic way, is called reciprocal (or  mutual) altruism. It means, that individuals tend to help someone, who is likely to give  something back. But it doesn\u2019t mean, that human beings are egoistic. People subconsciously  wait for the same attitude to them after performing altruistic actions (there the golden rule of  morality2 is taken place). Alexander Shmakov, the author of the article \u201cThe purpose for just  cooperation as a motive of economic behavior\u201d, provides us with results of the experiment,  which shows the relevancy of the statement, which was made above:\n\nBoth of two players (A and B) were provided with a certain amount of money (a and b  respectively). Firstly, player A is asked to give a part of his money to player B, and after that  player B is also asked to give money to A. Both players are free to choose any amount of money  (x or y respectively) they want to give or not to give anything at all.\n\nThe rational strategy for both players will be not give money. Because in case, when A decided  to share, it would not be profitable for B to share money (b + xa \u2014 yb < b + xa). And if A decided  not to give money, B would not give money either. However, in reality, when the experiment  took place, the results showed that 20 of 30 pairs of students shared their money. The average  received sum of money were 32,5% of the initial one. But in case, when one of the players\n\n1 The definition is taken from https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Homo_economicus .  2 Treat people the way you want to be treated.\n\nPlayer A \/ Player B  To give money  Not to give\n\nTo give money  a + yb \u2014 xa, b + xa \u2014 yb  a \u2014 xa, b + xa\n\nNot to give  a + yb, b \u2014 yb  a, b\n\ndenied the opportunity of cooperation ones, in most of the cases it put the end for the future  transaction, as the condition of relicense was lost.\n\nOne more thing, which can help us to understand the phenomenon of altruism, is economic  games. There exist a lot of such games, but the most famous are \u201cDictator\u201d, \u201cUltimatum\u201d and  \u201cThe division of the public good\u201d.  In \u201cDictator\u201d game one the players receives a sum of money,  part of which he\/she can give to another player. The rational behavior, which is expected from  the first person, is not to give anything, as only in this case he\/she will get the maximum  possible profit. Strangely, but in 616 experiments3, which were carried out, an average given  sum was about 28,35% of the initial sum and only about 1\/3 of all participants gave nothing. The  motive for such altruistic action is probably a sense of justice, as the first person did nothing in  order to get money, so he\/she thinks, that it would be fair to share them.\n\nAnother explanation of altruism is people\u2019s consciousness about their reputation. As I  mentioned above, altruism is socially approved behavior, so individuals, who are known for  helping people around, may be in more respect, than others. So, the motives for the altruistic  actions can be not only empathy, but also concern for the opinion of others.  Charity donations  are a good example of an altruistic action, which has a considerable impact in person\u2019s  reputation. In most of the charity cases only small donations are made anonymously, but  names of people, who donate huge amounts of money, are usually well-known and numerous  times mentioned in newspapers, magazines and TV programs. So, philanthropists may expect  more support from the society, if they need, as they are known as a good person.\n\nDeveloping the idea about philanthropy, we face another reason for being altruistic. This  motive is about being conscious of the future of the civilization, also known as communal  interest, which differ people from animals. People want to live in comfortable conditions,  where hospitals, education and other social institutions work well enough. So, they are ready to  contribute to the common good in order to provide their families and themselves with better  life. That is why the idea of social altruism appeared. Scientists faced the fact, that they are  unable to explain why people continue help others even, when they do not have any filiation at  all. This type of behavior started to take place, when human\u2019s intentions goes beyond family  and reputational altruism. Ernst Fehr and Urs Fischbacher in their article \u201cNature of human  altruism\u201d call this phenomenon a strong reciprocity, which works under the possibility of  altruistic remuneration or altruistic punishment (stigmatization).\n\nTaking all things into consideration, we can conclude, that altruism has a significant economic  effect not only on one particular person or a small social group, but on the whole society. And  strange, as it may seem, altruistic behavior can be profitable for the altruist as well as for  someone, who receives help. Moreover, many social organizations, even economic ones, would  not work at all, if people behaved themselves only in egoistic way, as due to desire to get the  maximum possible profit people may break adopted regulations, what may ruin the whole  system.\n\n3 Kazantseva T.V.
